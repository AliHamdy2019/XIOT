# in this project i replaced the arduino with an atmega16
# the serial monitor with and lcd 
u will find two folders 1-Xiot which contain the codes 
                        2-Xiot simulation which contain a simulation of the task
                        
the simulation is done by proteus 7.7 and make sure to put the elf file at the micro-controller from the debug folder in Xiot folder

the codes are well Documented and the simulation both explain every thing
