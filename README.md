# XIOT
# in this project i replaced the arduino with an atmega16
# the serial monitor with and lcd 
u will find two folders 1-Xiot which contain the codes 
                        2-Xiot simulation which contain a simulation of the task
                        
open the the codes folder with eclipse and make that folder the workplace                         

the simulation is done by proteus 7.7

the codes are well Documented and the simulation both explain every thing
