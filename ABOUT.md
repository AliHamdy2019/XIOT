# i wanted to make the task with an appropriate micro controller not an arduino
in the projected i didn't learn much becasue i recenlt made a bigger project 
a security system,based on three Avr Micro-controllers, communication between them, three Keypads
and LCDs, RF module and Finger print module,fire and temperature and PIR sensors ,implemented
on PCB
so the required task was one part of that project
